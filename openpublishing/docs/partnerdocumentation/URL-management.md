# URL Management #
Your URL will be defined by the domain where content gets published, locale, docset name,  folder structure, and file names in your repo. 

For example, this URL https://int.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/openpublishing/corefx/intro-clr tells us: 

- **https://int.msdn.microsoft.com** is the domain where you are publishing, MSDN in this case. This is defined in Repo.json.
- **en-us** indicates the locale
- **Openpublishing** - Is the name of the docset
- **corefx** - indicates the folder structure: openpublishing + corefx
- **intro-clr** is the file name.

This makes the content more discoverable, and easy to find in the repos for both content owners and contributors.
