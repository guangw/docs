# Open Publishing Backlog #

Our backlog is available in TFS: [Open Publishing - Feature list](https://mseng.visualstudio.com/web/qr.aspx?puri=vstfs%3a%2f%2f%2fClassification%2fTeamProject%2fdfe297d9-5f61-4d42-b4bb-03f8b8646944&path=VSChina%2fShared+Queries%2fVSOpenPublishing%2fOpen+Publishing+-+Feature+list).

# How to file Feature Requests, Bugs, or Live Site Issues #
You can use the TFS above or use the MSDNHelp Portal. 

The MSDN Help Portal can be used for requests by Internal Customers, Partners, and Stakeholders via a form without the need to deal with TFS. All submissions will result in a TFS work item being created in [https://mseng.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/VSChina/_workitems](https://mseng.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/VSChina/_workitems "Open Publishing TFS") and an email confirmation sent to the submitter and the person the work item is assigned to. The email contains a link to the TFS work item. In several cases, the project, Assigned To, Area Path, Iteration, and other fields get their values based on the form selections made by the submitter.
