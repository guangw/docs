## GitHub-flavored Markdown and Extensions

## GFM ##
Open Publishing supports authoring topics in GitHub-flavored Markdown (GFM)

Here are two great tutorials for Markdown and GitHub Flavored Markdown:

	• [Introduction to Markdown by John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
	• [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/)

You can use any Markdown editor (like [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/), [Visual Studio Code]

(https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/code-vs.aspx), [Markdown Mode]

(https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/0855e23e-4c4c-4c82-8b39-24ab5c5a7f79)) you like to edit Markdown 

files. Most of them provide live preview functionality so that you can get a simple preview when writing the 

topic.

## Open Publishing Extensions ##
We also support some extensions to enrich Markdown functionality:
	1. File include (other MD files and images)
	2. Internal code samples
