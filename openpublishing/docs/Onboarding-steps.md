# Onboarding to Open Publishing #

We can have several cases of onboarding into Open Publishing:


- New team -> The team has not created the content yet, they will do in OP.
- OA -> The team currently has their content in OA.
- MTPS -> The team is already publishing to MTPS via CAPS, build system, DxStudio, etc.
- Other-> The team is publishing their content outside MTPS, like "Read the docs". 

The following is a list of tasks both teams and VSC need to do for onboarding:
