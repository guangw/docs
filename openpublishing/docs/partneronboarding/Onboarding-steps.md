# Onboarding steps to Open Publishing #

We can have several cases of onboarding into Open Publishing:


- New team -> The team has not created the content yet, they will do in OP.
- OA -> The team currently has their content in OA.
- CMS -> The team has their content in CAPS, DxStudio, WDCML.
- CAPS/DxStudio -> The team has their content in CAPS or DxStudio.
- Other-> The team has their content in another repository, like "Read the docs" 

The following is a list of tasks teams need to do for onboarding:
